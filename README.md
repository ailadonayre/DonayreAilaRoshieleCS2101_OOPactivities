## :cherries: About Aila
Hi! I am **Aila Roshiele C. Donayre**, a 2nd year BS Computer Science Students from Batangas State University - The NEU Alangilan, and I consider myself a *passionate beginner* in the grand realm of programming. This is my first time immersing in the depths of Java programming and it has definitely given me its fair share of headaches and problems in the course of my exploration. We all have to start somewhere, right? Nonetheless, I managed to persevere and arrive at the near end of the semester, sustaining a whole lot of novel experiences and above all, comprehension in programming with Java. Truly, this rollercoaster ride has been an exciting one, now I am more than psyched up to move on to my next! ðŸŽ¢

## :star2: Acknowledgment
To my professor, **Miss Fatima Marie Agdon**, thank you for feeding me the knowledge that was pivotal in the completion of my requirements for this course. Your interactive and intelligible fashion in teaching was crucial to the improvements that I possess today, as someone who was once foreign to Java and programming, at large. Though I am all but still an amateur in this field, I will certainly carry the practices and key elements that you have shared to my future prospects in life as I continue to progress to the portrait of my dreams.
